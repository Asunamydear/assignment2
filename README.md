Call neighbour of a member m of an encoding any of the at most eight members of the grid whose value is 1
and each of both indexes differs from m’s corresponding index by at most 1. Given a particular encoding, we
inductively define for all natural numbers d the set of polygons of depth d (for this encoding) as follows. Let a
natural number d be given, and suppose that for all d
0 < d, the set of polygons of depth d
0 has been defined.
Change in the encoding all 1’s that determine those polygons to 0. Then the set of polygons of depth d is
defined as the set of polygons which can be obtained from that encoding by connecting 1’s with some of their
neighbours in such a way that we obtain a maximal polygon (that is, a polygon which is not included in any
other polygon obtained from that encoding by connecting 1’s with some of their neighbours)
